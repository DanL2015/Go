# Go
围棋/Go Game using C++ with SFML for graphics
Rules:
1. 19x19 board
2. Black goes first
3. If pieces surrounded on all four sides (3 or 2 if piece is on the side of the board), it will be captured (all area within the pieces need to be filled in)
4. Whoever cannot move next loses

Idk how to actually play this game, my dad likes it and it was pretty simple so I just coded it.
Also the textures and everything are really ugly and it doesn't work very well.
